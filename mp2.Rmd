## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r, include = FALSE, messgae = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
general_house <- house_elections %>%
  filter(general_votes != 0) #filter the house_elections data down to only the general elections
num_candidates <- general_house %>%
  arrange(state, district) %>%
  group_by(state, district) %>%
  summarize(N = n()) %>%
  filter(N != 1)
```
