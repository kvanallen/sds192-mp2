## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r, include = FALSE, messgae = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
general_house <- house_elections %>%
  filter(general_votes != 0)
```
