## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

This is Clara's contribution for lab 13! My terminal isn't working but maybe this will! (Update from 5 minutes later: it did *not* work.)
